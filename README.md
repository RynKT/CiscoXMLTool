# CiscoXMLTool
Basically, it creates very basic XML configuration files for Cisco phones. Just give the tool some parameters, and it'll create files that should get your phone ready to use for SIP. Files will be created in whatever folder you download the code to. Make sure to downlaod the right firmware files for your phone!
